            <strong>Banana pudding </strong>is our spirit dessert: It's not
            super classy but always welcome at any party because people can't
            not dig into it. We've turned banana pudding into everything:
            <em>cheesecake, bars, ice cream.</em> But this is our number one —
            and takes only 20ish minutes to make.

          <li>3 c. heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 box vanilla wafer cookies (12 oz.)</li>

        <h2>DIRECTIONS:</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine milk, vanilla pudding mix and
          sweetened condensed milk. Whisk thoroughly, breaking up any lumps, and
          refrigerate for at least 5 minutes, or until set.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          In another large bowl, combine heavy cream and vanilla. Beat until
          stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside half of the mixture for
          topping the dish. Fold remaining half into the pudding mixture.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Cover the bottom of a 3-quart trifle dish with vanilla wafers. Top
          with one-third of the pudding mixture. Cover with another layer of the
          wafer cookies—you may want to also stand some cookies up vertically,
          so you see the full circle along the edge of the trifle dish. Top with
          an even layer of banana slices. Continue layering the pudding, wafer
          cookies and banana slices until you reach the top, ending with a final
          layer of banana pudding.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to overnight.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Sweeten the remaining whipped cream: Add sugar to whipped cream,
          stirring to combine. Just before serving, dollop on top of the banana
          pudding, then sprinkle crumbled wafer cookies on top.
